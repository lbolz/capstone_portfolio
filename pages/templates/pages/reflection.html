<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Research indicates that reflecting on work can improve job performance. 
As a part of my capstone, I completed reflections on my work-based learning experience. You can read them below:</p>

<h2>Mid-Year Reflection</h2>

<p>
So far, which competency have you demonstrated the most progress towards? Also, how do you plan to further your progress?
</p>

<p>
So far with my capstone, I think that I have made the most progress towards the professionalism competency. 
The main reason for this, is simply because I've become more comfortable sending emails to people. 
Much more of my work has revolved around communication than I thought it would, and thus the task of sending an email has become less daunting than ever before.
 Thus, I think that I have made the most progress with the professionalism competency.
 </p>

<p>
As I continue with my capstone, I think that my immediate goal is to work on my time and resources competency. 
This is because the Django Girls Arlington workshop is coming up <b>soon</b>, and so that is my immediate concern. 
Thus, I've been spending lots of time working on making sure that our timing and resources work for this workshop.

<h2>Monthly Reflections</h2>

<h3>November</h3>

<p>This month, I started a new project at my work. 
It’s called Testament, and it is used by the Books to Prisoners in DC to help prisoners obtain books from throughout the country. 
We had to upgrade the software to a newer version since the old one is going out of date. 
I worked in conjunction with Edzon to start this project, and was also in charge of emailing the original developers to tell them that we were doing this. 
I was originally quite a bit nervous to work on this, since I don’t have any experience with Python 2 (which is what we were upgrading from). 
However, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be- the answer was to almost everything was on Google. 
As I continue with this project, I want to focus on communicating with Edzon about progress throughout the week. 
This is because we only communicate on Thursdays, but I still work throughout the week, and because I am reluctant to send emails, I think it is something I should work on. 
As a result of this project, I have learned how to upgrade software and communicate with developers outside of the company.</p>

<h3>December</h3>

<p>This month, I started/continued two projects, and finished the last one. 
The two projects involve upgrading software from earlier (and outdated) versions. 
One of the projects, Sign and Read, will be a group effort from within the company, and we’ll be working in a group of people to get this done, which will be a new experience. 
So far, I think that things are slow to start (as we all work remotely), but I think things will pick up now that we’ve started. 
As I continue with this project, I will make sure to turn things in on time and communicate effectively with my group. </p>
